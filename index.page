/* CSS provided by cwillu of #lesswrong. This CSS:
1. reflows sections to use up all horizontal whitespace so every section fits on 1 screen
2. hides the Table of Contents (not needed since all sections are visible) */

div#TOC { display: none; }
/* Hide metadata which is not interesting for index.page */
