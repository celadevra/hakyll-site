	abstract = {For more than a decade, Ruby developers have turned to The Ruby Way for reliable “how-to” guidance on effective Ruby programming. Now, Hal Fulton and André Arko have thoroughly updated this classic guide to cover new language enhancements and developers’ experiences through Ruby 2.1.     The new edition illuminates Ruby 2.1 through 400+ examples, each answering the question: “How do I do this in Ruby?” For each example, they present both a task description and realistic technical constraints. Next, they walk step-by-step through presenting one good solution, offering detailed explanations to promote deeper understanding.     Conveniently organized by topic, The Ruby Way, Third Edition makes it easier than ever to find the specific solution you want—and to write better code by reflecting Ruby’s unique philosophy and spirit.     Coverage includes      Ruby 2.1 overview: terminology, philosophy, and basic principles     Best practices for strings and regular expressions     Efficiently internationalizing your code     Performing calculations (including trigonometry, calculus, statistics, and time/date calculations)     Working with “Rubyesque” objects such as symbols and ranges     Using arrays, hashes, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and other data structures     Efficiently storing data with YAML, JSON, and SQLite3     Leveraging object-oriented and dynamic features, from multiple constructors to program inspection     Building GUIs with Shoes 4, Ruby/Tk, Ruby/GTK3, QtRuby, and other toolkits     Improving thread performance by understanding Ruby’s synchronization methods and avoiding its pitfalls     Automating system administration with Ruby     Data formats: JSON, XML, RSS, Atom, RMagick, PDF, and more     Testing and debugging with RSpec, Minitest, Cucumber, byebug, and pry     Measuring Ruby program performance     Packaging and distributing code, and managing dependencies with Bundler     Network programming: clients, time servers, POP, SMTP, IMAP, Open-URI     Web applications: HTTP servers, Rails, Sinatra, HTML generation, and more     Writing distributed Ruby software with drb     Choosing modern development tools that maximize your productivity     All source code for this book may be downloaded at www.rubyhacker.com.      informit.com/aw  informit.com/ruby  rubyhacker.com/therubyway  therubyway.io},
