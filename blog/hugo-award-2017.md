雨果奖名单[昨天公布](http://www.tor.com/2017/04/04/2017-hugo-award-finalists-announced/)。今年的名单包括了数量较多的女性和有色人种作者，其多样性令人鼓舞。

“小狗”们今年[遭到了相当明确的抵制](http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/4/15178480/2017-hugo-award-nominations-science-fiction-fantasy-books)。

> The Hugos have been unusually contentious over the past couple of years, with a pair of fan groups calling themselves the Sad Puppies and Rabid Puppies aggressively pushing voting slates favoring white men and conservative outlooks. Voters have consistently rejected Puppy-nominated works. This year, the Puppy groups were relatively muted, with only a few slated works making it to the finalist stage of voting.

值得一提的是 _the Expanse_ 的第一季季终集 Leviathan Wakes 获得了最佳剧作短篇类的提名，而获得长篇小说奖提名的 Charlie Jane Anders 曾是 io9 的编辑。
