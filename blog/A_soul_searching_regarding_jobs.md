*a la* a job interview.

*Please introduce yourself.*

I am one with enormous capability and want to put it to best use. I love books and aspire to be involved in the making and distribution of text media that change how people think and act. The way I learn, play and engage with the world is shaped by Internet, and I want to be part of its shaping force.

*Please tell us about the job you do now.*

I am now working as a project manager for \[REDACTED], which is an extension to the Ministry of Environmental Protection. Our job as an organization is to devise and implement environmental and industrial projects that fulfill China's obligations under various international environmental conventions, using funding by foreign donors under these conventions. My team works on the ozone-protecting Montreal Protocol, specifically, on converting PU foam sector to stop using ozone depleting foam agents.

*Sounds interesting. So why are you looking for a new job?*

There are multiple reasons. The simplest one is economic. The organization only provides project management service and therefore is only supported with project management fee and the State Treasury's money. The Montreal Protocol is the most successful environmental convention with the most practical funding system, but even that doesn't leave much for us. One of the major income source for the organization dries up in 2015 so I need to find better opportunities so the family economy won't be disrupted too severely.

The main reason however, is that after 5 years, I gained enough understanding of the governments and the enterprises' roles in international environmental governance, and I cannot persuade myself that this is the thing I want to do now, or in the future. On this position one have some power by making things more complicated for the industries, while transforming oneself into a drone. If I continue to do it for more than 5 years, I will be just repeating myself.

I want to do something that makes a tangible outcome.

*What's your career plan?*

5 years of project management experience lies the bedrock for my career. The question now is, what kind of house I want to build? Project management is a trade of generalists, meaning I am able to invest my energy and time in almost any industry. I want my career to both create value to the economy and satisfy my curiousity about how the world as a complex system works. 

I consider my career a process of self-making. Through my career I want to build a vision. The vision enables me to identify important issues that influence people's wellbeing and continued existence on the Earth. Afterwards, I can make real and everlasting impact on people's lives.

Many people have already obtained such a vision, through their learning and working experience. For me, the path to the vision lies in two things, Internet and geography.

Internet is both an abstraction of people's interaction modes and an additional layer over many human activities. It is shaping our culture by amplifying some forms of interaction and suppressing others. It is essential to understand Internet before I can understand how and why populations think and act.

Contrary to many claims, geography is more relevant in the Internet age, at least before we upload ourselves to the cloud. The amplified and complex interactions of thoughts and powers will register their impact in geographical spaces and places.

Now, \[REDACTED] is one of the largest Internet company, and one with the most extensive geographical network of suppliers, customers and everything in between, I cannot think of any better place to have a career of building a vision.

*What's your most proud achievement in your current job?*

I wrote a manual for a whole sector's conversion projects!
