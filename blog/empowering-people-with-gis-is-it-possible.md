title: Empowering people with GIS. Is it possible?

I have been looking at various web-based GIS and mapping solutions in recent days. These tools have made it much easier to make professional looking maps and publish them or use them in mobile applications. There is Mapbox who does impressive work with map data, and CartoDB which makes it really easy to use PostGIS and geodata. In China there are also efforts to share data and build user-friendly GIS platforms.

At this point it is useful to ask myself whether it is beneficial to join the battle of platforms. If I make another platform would it be sensible and profitable? With a bunch of tools competing in terms of functionality and usability, it is strange that few people and businesses consider it important to integrate geoinformation in their decision-making, and also strange few know and care about these new developments in GIS and relevant industries.

Maybe GIS hasn't tried hard enough to make itself more relevant. People make good decisions with geoinformation or bad ones without geoinformation, while having no knowledge about the process. If GIS really is a part of the world's future, it has to be more relevant and recognizable. Mapping efforts should be visible and tangible. Maps should be everyone's creation.

GIS has been a background and back office operation since the beginning. "Normal people" doesn't know what is geographic information, no to mention how to use it. GIS in the foreground means that people know what kinds of data are available, and what to do with them. The current obstacles are: 1) data are scattered around in professional bodies, so very few people know how to find them; and 2) data are seldom ready for use, requiring professional knowledge and skills to adapt them for specific usage.

CartoDB has done something about this. Using PostGIS as the backend enables relatively uniform means of storing and querying data. But the non-geometry data still needs explanation and notation. Don't expect non-experts know the meaning of the datasets and can use them without issues.

Mapping has been greatly democratized by web maps, namely Google Maps and others, and mashup possibilities. But for non-geographers, mapping still requires programming skills and aesthetics education, which rarely coexist in a single person. For the lay people to make good maps, imitation and steal may still be the answer in the long age to come. A mapping platform should encourage people to build on existing maps if mapping should be democratized further.

Finally, everyone is making a map in one fashion or another. At least, everyone needs a mental map to navigate the vicinity in everyday life. We also need hand-drawn or printed maps to show others locations and directions. The information revolution so far hasn't encouraged such behaviours in the cyberspace. This is not something to be proud of by the GIS professionals. Only when everyone is making maps will the value of a map rich with information and beautiful by design be recognized. And only when everyone is making maps will GIS have enough data to describe the world.

So for my ideal mapping solution, the data, the tools and the clients should form a loop, that constantly feeds itself. Everyone are at the same time consumers and contributors of information, and the platform evolves with new data and new possibilities.
