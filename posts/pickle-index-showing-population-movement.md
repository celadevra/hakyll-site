["Pickle Index" showing migrant workers exiting from Yangtze and Zhujiang Deltas](http://news.xinhuanet.com/2013-08/10/c_116891518.htm) (In Chinese)

In a rare case where Chinese government officials show innovation and genius, an unnamed official from the National Development and Reform Committee (NDRC) discovered that mustard (*Zha Cai*) sales is indicating that migrant workers are leaving Zhujiang Delta and the eastern part of China for their homes in mid- and western China.

This index may well be useful, as *Zha Cai* is an essential delicacy in the meals of migrant workers all over China. The Pickle Index represents an important trend that millions will need jobs in traditionally agriculture-dominated areas of China, posing challenges to infrastructures and economy.
