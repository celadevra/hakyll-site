MapBox [showcases](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/drone-imagery-openstreetmap/) how they use a (relatively) inexpensive [drone](http://www.sensefly.com/drones/ebee.html) to take aerial photographs that can be used in OpenStreetMap and other imagery applications.

For some applications, you don't need to buy hi-res satellite images any more.
