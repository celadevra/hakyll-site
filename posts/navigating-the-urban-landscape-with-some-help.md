[Urban Compass](https://www.urbancompass.com/) is a website that helps tenants to find suitable rooms to rent in New York. The difference is that it describes the street and cultural landscape for each area in the city, so the user can have a understanding of what to expect if they decide to live there. The website also let you get an appointment with a local guide, who can show you the house and surrounding streets, in person. So you can get local knowledge about the landscape (street, buildings, people ...) in which you are going to live. This should create more successful rent contracts than those just giving you a number to call and a quote to ponder about.

The approach of Urban Compass is more 'humane', to be sure. But from user experience perspective, I think a map should still be a part of the tools the website uses. For example, in the description of Harlem, it says the neighbourhood is not for people who would like to spend the night in a bar, as there are not many. But what if a adjacent area is teeming with bar and booze, shouldn't it be a factor that one would like to consider?

A Chinese website for bridging landlords and tenants, <http://www.ihezhu.com/>, may be trying to copy the methods used by Urban Compass. I may spend some time on that site, even if just to see what people says about the cities that I am visiting.
