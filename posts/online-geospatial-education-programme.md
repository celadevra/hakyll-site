Programme provided by [PennState](https://gis.e-education.psu.edu/).  I think the classes are wonderfully set up, but one needs considerable energy to finish the lecturer-led courses and get certificates/degrees.  Right now I don't think I can spare time for this, but I will check back once I have more free time.  The course materials are more or less open for access, so one can also study at their own pace (but no Certificates, of course).
