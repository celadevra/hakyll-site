In China, the governance system is good at concentrating resources and manpower to solve difficult problems. Thanks to this, China can boast a one-third increase in forest coverage in just 20 years, from 1990 to 2010. However, just as the monotonous species composition in the new forests illustrates, by doing so, it is easy to overlook issues and lose the holistic perspective.

This month, the Central Government of China issued a detailed [plan](http://www.gov.cn/zwgk/2013-09/12/content_2486773.htm) to fight the worsening air pollution all over China, especially that in economically advanced areas such as North China and the Yangtze Delta. The plan is very ambitious, and makes a lot of sense. Although many measures look familiar, thanks to the similar acts proposed by the Ministry of Environmental Protection in the past, the enforcement this time would be much more effective -- because it is the whole government, organizing the whole nation, to tackle the air pollution problem, not just the often ignored Ministry of Environmental Protection.

The emphasis on the severity of the problem ("air pollution [...] damages the health of the people, and threatens the stability of the society") implies that the government will coordinate many departments of the economy and the society to reduce air pollution. Ironically, in the effort to solve one environmental problem, the decision makers simply did not consult with other environmental interests adequately.

One example is the call for adding more clean energy, including hydroelectric and photovoltic energies, to the national grids. The plan has no mention about constructing smart power grids to support the new energies. For the negative impacts of developing these energy sources, it only says something about "develop in an orderly manner", nothing about biodiversity loss, or the pollution from making solar panels.

The plan also lacks a geographic perspective: key areas with severe pollutions are identified, but nothing about where to accept the enterprises ousted, or where to install the solar panel farms, or where can hydroelectric power can be utilized.

Therefore, I am optimistic that the plan will solve China's air problem, but I am also worried that it may create some other environmental problems in the process. To avoid this, the local governments have to take initiative and be innovative, which is not something to be optimistic about.
