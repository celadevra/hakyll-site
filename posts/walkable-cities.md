Walkable cities are desirable. Yet why so many people choose to live in suburbs? In the US, it is because they want to be close to the "nature" and can afford the higher housing cost (or used to be able to afford), but in emerging economies, I would rather consider the choice a result of people getting "pushed out" of preferred urban living areas. The effect on the landscape is the same: people are living farther to where they work and recreate, but the motives and hurdles to reenter the city would be different.

Consider the housing cost in the city a curve, not unlike the Kuznets Curve, with the cost rising at the early period of urbanization and falling later. In emerging economies, there is a high chance that the housing cost will follow this curve. On the early half of the curve, the city does not have enough density to be walkable: there are too few factories and commercial establishments to be distributed around the land, and there are too few people to support the economy.

While the problem in the US is suburban sprawl, in emerging economies the problem is urban sprawl: lands are unnecessarily turned into low-density urban areas, and the local authorities and developers have plenty of incentive to do so, instead of upgrading existing urban landscape to support more people. This in turn results in cities designed for more vehicles instead of for more people, pushing more people out of the city.

There are no painless solutions, especially when residents in emerging economies crave so much about spacious houses as a token of success. If we want to let people live in smaller and denser cities, we need strong communities, which is hard to come by in turbulent economy and social transformations.
