Among Silicon Valley's startups, one enterprise has a unique goal: disrupt the way we take in our food.  Rob Rhinehart of Oakland-based Soylent is attempting to ~~make~~ [market](http://www.inc.com/christine-lagorio/soylent-start-up-hacking-food.html) a powdered food product that meets all our daily nutrient needs.

## Abstracting food

From a video provided by the startup on their [fund-raising campaign page](https://campaign.soylent.me/soylent-free-your-body), the paste food and the powder as its precursor is not very enticing.  But according to Mr. Rhinehart, the essence of food is a bunch of chemicals, and Soylent provides those.  This echoes profoundly with the abstraction of of a mind into a symbol of "brain in the vase".

In the interview with him by *Inc.*, Mr. Rhinehart does not deny the social and sensual dimensions of food nor the importance of cooking to some people.  But Soylent the powder makes nutrient intake a more efficient and very likely more healthy practice than doing it by eating chunks of dead plant or animal tissues.

What Mr. Rhinehart does not say, but implied, is that we will take the step from industrial food to real industrial food that does not depend on land, flora or fauna to produce.  After all, we have walked a [long way](http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2010/anniversary.html) in this direction, it is not so unimaginable to turn to purely synthesized food.

## (De)localizing food?

The efficiency of international trade, thanks to advanced means of transportation and food preservation, has shifted the definition of food from local produces to foreign delicacies.  This of course causes a multitude of criticism out of environmental and economic concerns.  Soylent may solve this problem: you cannot have local yam grown in Stockholm without significant energy costs, but you can always have a local chemical plant.  If Soylent succeeds, your food supply will always be local.

Then again, why we tree huggers yearn local food?  Because of the concept of place that is contained implicitly in the food.  Citrons from Spain and Israel are good thanks to the sunshine and sandy soils, and the great plain of the US yields best wheat with the help of Caribbean moisture.  We all know such and such things, but they will no longer make sense once we all start eating synthesized food from the local plant.

## Speed and social implications

One of the major selling point of Soylent is convenience.  This is also why Soylent is catering to other startups in the Valley.  Mr. Rhinehart says they were thinking about developing pills but had to abandon the idea as we still need mass to convince ourselves that we have eaten.  But Soylent as of now is fast enough: pour the powder and add water is all.

Mr. Rhinehart does not want to stand against gourmets.  He claims that we can still enjoy old fashioned meals from time to time.  However, the social dimensions of food does not begin nor end at the table or in the kitchen.  As Mr. Rhinehart says, food is energy, and the world pretty much runs around the food network as well as the oil network.  Disrupting food is the ultimate disruption.  If we turn thoroughly to synthesized food, millions of acres of land will need a new use, billions of people will have to get a new job, the socioeconomic and ecological implications will be too complicated to discuss here.

Moreover, our relationships with many species will be changed forever.  Will cows be obsolete?  If no one eats mutton anymore, will there still be sheep in England's National Parks?  Can we still tell eating what animal is acceptable and what not?

## Reinventing the wheel?

Soylent food is good for at least one thing, it is shelf stable and full of nutrient, therefore extremely suitable for hunger relief purposes.  This raises another question: don't we already have something similar?  Why invent the purely synthesized food when the food processing industry can do the same by grinding potatoes, beef and tomato and then dry the mixture?

But I see a future where synthesized food become a necessity and grown food a luxury.  Population is increasing in most parts of the World.  More land is needed to accommodate people, and the energy investment in the food industry is not sustainable.  By then we need to come up with some ideas with producing food.  Now that we have one, all the better.
