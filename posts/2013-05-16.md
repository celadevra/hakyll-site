[Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/) is probably the most widely used Web mapping product out there, and a few days ago, Google [announced](http://youtu.be/THxJHcR1D2c) on Google I/O 2013 that Maps is receiving a major update.  So it seems to be a good time to look back at how Google Map changed the way we see the geographic realities, by changing itself in the past 8 years.

## Google Local

Google Local was the predecessor of Google Maps, so it is worth mentioning here.

We sincerely believed that the Internet (or the World Wide Web), as the name suggests, is above and beyond places and borders.  But as the majority of contents on the Web that common people care about shifted from intellectual discussion and pornography to information on "real life" business, smart guys at Google began to realize that we need to be able to search for information that has a geographical dimension.

Before Google and others made "local" information searchable, the Internet was a space without identifiable, explicit places.  There are implied places, though.  Internet users may be especially interested in a newsgroup post if it was about their neighbourhoods or city, or written in a language they know.  But Google made explicit notion that even on the Internet, places matter, and they have taken it as their responsibility to index local information.

Google Local was mainly for businesses to advertise themselves to a more relevant audience: people near them.  Therefore it would be stretched to say it really brought a sense of places into the users' mind.  However, it does begin to help us better understand our vicinities and discover locations that we otherwise overlook.  A cultural turn starts: the Internet used to be a tool to overcome distances and escape from local limitations, now it was turning into a local guide[^1].

## The debut of Google Maps

And what would a guide be if one is not equipped with a map?  It is a natural step after integrating textual location information, to provide the information with a map.  Imagine you ask someone for direction and it is really hard to describe -- they draw a map.

So Google needed a map product.  In 2004, it acquired an Australia-based startup called Where 2 Technologies.  On February 8th, 2005, Google Maps was announced.  It officially become a part of Google Local on October 6th, 2005.

At this time "Search the map" is the default choice on the interface.  The other 2 are "Find businesses" and "Get directions".  Apparently, at this time Google expect people to use Maps pretty much like they use a paper map: open it, locate a general area of interest, and look closer.

It did not take very long for people to realize Google Maps is not simply putting a static, unchanging map on line for everyone to see.  Reverse-engineering was employed to "mash-up" information on top of the Maps.  Websites like chicagocrime.org[^2] showed the possibility of using Maps and other data sources as a quick and easy-to-use GIS system.  Google seized the trend, and debut the Google Maps API as early as June 2005.  The API allows websites to embed dynamic or static Google Maps on their pages, and is now the most used Web API.

You cannot overemphasize the importance of the event, nor is its potential fully revealed, even in 2013 as I write this article.  Geographical Information Science used to be a centralized practice, but now virtually every trade of life can participate in adding spatial knowledge to this huge database, either directly on the Maps page or through 3rd party tools.  It was argued that the API allowed people who were "under represented in GIS" to contribute to the knowledge, so the spatial factors in a society's building and evolving can be more democratized, such as planning and community development[^miller].

## Go down into the streets

Throughout 2006 Google Maps have been adding features and expanding its coverage of areas.  However, geographically speaking, the important development takes place in 2007.  On February 28th, real-time traffic info was added to maps of major cities in the US.  In May, Street View was added to major US cities as well.

These features would be found on a paper-based map only in the world of Harry Potter.  Indeed, a map like the Marauder's Map used by Harry in *the Prisoner of Azkaban* would be too scary for anyone, but a map showing jamming roads based on real-time and historical data is immensely useful.  When examining the possible advantages of digital maps over pen and paper maps, Goodchild (1988) mentioned the inconvenience of updating maps to reflect ever changing ground reality[^goodchild].  He believed that once technology allow us to use real-time data on a map, we will be able to better understand changes on the surface of the earth, instead of taking snapshots and ignoring transient processes as paper maps forced us to do.

Google's traffic info map have taken us one step closer to the ideal of real-time, constantly updating maps.  It shows a way of reducing the complexity of collecting and analyzing a gigantic quantity of data by combining sensor data and statistic algorithms.  Combined with the API, some brilliant ideas or practical needs, and [suitable means](http://aprs.fi/) to collecting data, it has already demonstrated [some pretty cool possibilities](http://www.cio.com/article/676687/10_Things_You_Can_Track_in_Real_Time_with_Google_Maps?page=1#slideshow).

Street View is a change of how we view our map.  We are used to a top-down perspective when we look at a map, and never thought a map can show such details.  Although this seems not to be important, Street View does give the user a sense of ground truth, and helps them to perceive the map in a more organic way.  In the more recent version of Street View, the user can even continuously navigate a city's road network in it.

Despite the [amazing technology](http://www.australianscience.com.au/research/google/36899.pdf) that enabled the product, Street View is a retro-style cartography project.  It bring the old school way of drawing a map ("here by the road is a tall birch tree and there under the hill you will see a church"), well after scientific map making utilizing geometric shapes drove those picture-like maps out.

To someone trained to read maps, this seems trivial.  However, this feature allow users to read scenes and landscapes when reading a map.  As a result, the user is more likely to establish a sense of place and identity, because the mosaic of communities and the impact of culture on the landscape and shopfront is again for people to see.  These variations of geographic features are exactly what define places, and are what cartography give up as the cost of concise and useful map.

## Google Map Maker

In 2011 Google launched the Map Maker tool which allows everyone to add their local knowledge to the platform.  Compared to tools with similar purposes, such as OpenStreetMap, tool provided by Google seems easier to use, but arguably damped down so as not to replace Google's own data.

Like to Web 3.0, Google was late to Map 3.0.  But maybe Google is still the best advocate of crowd sourced map making, thanks to its influence and reputation.  Unlike passively reading a map, adding points of interest on a map forces one to think about spatial relations between oneself and their surrounding.

The emergence of features and information on a map is another wonder to behold, although I can only speak from my experience using OpenStreetMap and Wikipedia.  One edit may hint others to contribute more, to shape and present both a geospatial and cultural context for an area.  This was not possible to do at a large scale, but new technologies are making it a possible trend.

In some instances, the crowd sourced map is used to engage policy makers and the public[^3].  Given adequate publicity, this can be a great way for the administration to listen to a wide range of people.  Arguably, neither Google Map Maker nor OpenStreetMap seem to develop features facilitating this.  Existing examples are using Google's own API.  It would be interesting to see the development on this front.

## New map and what to expect

What can be induced from the [keynote presentation](http://youtu.be/Tdx0oQzvPAY), is that it is becoming more personal, more social, and perhaps raising the bar for products using its API.

Google will bring the Internet closer to the geographic landscape.  The places on the Google Map will not only have a location, among its attributes there are also online reviews and your friend's visit record.  Your perception of your city's geography will not only depend on the actual landscape, but the interpretation of the space on the Web.  On the one hand, your Internet activities will affect what you are likely to discover as much as your off-line activities, as Google will try to recommend to you places you expressed interest online or those similar to where you have visited; on the other hand, what kind of friends you have and their interests will bring you closer to their tastes online and to their hangouts in your city.

Unnervingly, this raises the question of whether this put us into a bubble of space, similar to the Internet bubble that Google and recommendation engines put us in, preventing us to explore and find new places.  Indeed, this is the feeling I have when I watch the keynote and they mentioned "exploring", which is in fact recommendation.

The new map also marks the convergence of online and offline spaces.  The new map will meet our expectation of using an augmented paper map, and it makes the Internet more relevant to the geographical space.  In combination to Google Glass, which tries to make real-life objects more relevant online, Google's new Map heralds an era when Internet is the landscape and vice versa, and every one must adapt their geography to this complex space.
