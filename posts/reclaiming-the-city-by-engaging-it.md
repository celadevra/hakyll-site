[City belong to us](http://www.aeonmagazine.com/living-together/cities-thrive-when-public-space-is-really-public/)

This is a moving article asking the question: did we forget what cities are good for?  Cities were built for trade in the beginning, for sure.  But their functions have evolved afterwards.  Cities are supposed to provide spaces where interactions take place, where people meet people, not only vendors meet customers, but also artists meet patrons, idea meet followers, friends meet friends.  Consumerism and technology have practically erased public spaces from cities.  The only way to reclaim the city is to take actions, to go out and meet people, be them accquaintances or strangers.
