Cyberspace have similarities with the 'real' space.  But this may be exactly the reason why the combination of location and Internet has not gone quite well in recent years.  Foursquare check-ins are falling, Gowalla has boomed, busted, is bought and forgotten.  The knock-offs in China [does not fare particularly well either](http://www.ifanr.com/318992).  The concensus in the business is

In this situation, is it still sensible to talk about Location Based Services?  Check-in is dead, and developers have no idea how to make location-based social networks work.  The reason is simple: social networks are never location based.  Social networks are based on shared experiences.  It is a common fallacy to think that people have to be together to share a experience, and it is a bigger blunder to think that steady and fruitful relationships can exist just because people are near.  If those wishful thinkings were true, and people can friend each other just by getting geographically close, modern society would not exist because everyone is hanging out with the first persons they meet in the street (or outside the cave).

> [Thing is: proximity, in and of itself, just isn’t that interesting -- when you consider that people are in regular enough contact with their friends to be able to find out if or know if they’re nearby without checking a location database. And also that urban geography rarely favours the kind of serendipitous encounters proximity social networks were supposed to deliver. Big cities are too sprawling to easily engineer chance meetings between friends, while smaller locations likely mean friend groups coalesce on the same hang-outs anyway so don’t need an app for that.](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/23/location-vs-communication/)

It would not be very unfair to say that the last generation of LBS, represented by Foursquare and similar, has made grave mistakes by trying to combine location and social network -- they should focus on making a catalog that provide goodies to users, and recommend them by vicinity and user preference.  Actually, [a few apps](http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-location-based-food-recommendation-application-for-the-iPhone) has gone this path and arguably fare better than check-in based apps.

If check-in is too tiresome and you don't like it, how about make apps that automatically get your location and store them for analysis and better recommendation?  I think it is a sinister road to take.

The integration of LBS into SNS has to be done in a less intrusive and more helpful way.  Instead of getting in the way to arrange meeting place and time (we have good old phone for that purpose), maybe LBS can remind you to bring umbrella for a passing rain?  Instead of help you shout "I'm here!", an app giving a tip that "your father's favourite wine is on sale in the shop around the block" may be more socially acceptable?  LBS in SNS is a failure now, but given adequate data support, it may transform itself from a self-centered boasting tool to a geography-aware feature.
