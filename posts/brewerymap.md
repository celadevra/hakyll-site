[FlowingData](http://flowingdata.com/2013/08/01/brewerymap-plans-your-next-beer-road-trip/) covers an interesting mashup built on Google Maps.  You can use it to plan a summer brewery trip from point A to point B.

For places other than those in USA, your result may vary.  For example, it seems nothing exists between a brewery in Beijing and the famous Tsingdao Beer, which I believe is not the ground truth:

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.brewerymap.com/embed?t=r&from=Tsingdao&to=Beijing&d=25&w=450&h=350"></script>

This is what GIS should do, though the example seem trivial: help connect the dots (data points) into useful paths and insights.
