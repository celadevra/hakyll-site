This week there is an interesting [article](http://news.yahoo.com/glare-london-skyscraper-melted-jaguar-133036022.html) on how a futuristic building in London managed to reflect deadly sunlight onto a nearby pavement and roadside parking, and melted plastic components of a Jaguar's exterior. It is the speculation of many physicists that the curved shape of the building may be to blame. Or summer sunlight in England could never be intense enough to melt anything.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zongo/8859375267/" title="London 034 Walkie Talkie Building by David Holt London, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3699/8859375267_31f9e4d683_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="London 034 Walkie Talkie Building"></a>

No doubt the design and construction of the building have been approved by the planning and environmental departments of the City of London. Considering this is a building with glass curtain wall, the planners and architects may have even run some reflection simulation to see the impact on nearby buildings, but they did not anticipate that at a certain time of a year, the sunlight concentrated by the curve of the building would be hot enough to [fry an egg](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2013/sep/03/london-walkie-talkie-skyscraper-video).

Why the GIS tools that we use could not identify the problem before the building is built? Current 3-D GIS systems can do a fine job of telling you how the block will look like when the building is being built and complete, or how the traffic would be affected. Yet it loses grasp on the effect of some processes on microscales such as a particular parking position on the pavement. Many of us are used to work at a scale of kilometres when working with a GIS system, enjoying the ability to process a sea of data at a time, but sometimes the details determine whether a project is feasible or not.

On other fronts, Google Art Project is utilizing StreetView [technology](https://sites.google.com/a/pressatgoogle.com/art-project/technology-behind-the-art-project) to create a virtual museum that the audiences can immerse in. Location information has reached a new detail level. Soon, people may demand such information for other locations, for example, the location of a certain seat in a stadium. Given the trend of storage and processing capacities' development, I have no doubt these demands are to be met by some startups.

As geographical information is helping more people in their everyday life, they will permeate into more personal scales. It is nice to know how to get a mall from my current location, it would be better to know where I shall park my car and be able to locate it when I return from my shopping. Such applications call for not only better sensors and larger data storage, but also for more nuanced understanding of everyday routines such as the movement of the sun across the sky. An implementation would be difficult and only solving a particular problem at a time, but a new paradigm of GIS may emerge from such efforts.
