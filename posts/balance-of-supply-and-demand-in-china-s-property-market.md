> Even the pessimists are not necessarily predicting imminent disaster. Ms Stevenson-Yang, for one, says that the bubble could take as much as five years to burst, with prices to drop by 40% from current levels. The more sanguine, meanwhile, insist that inflated local markets in smaller cities can burst without puncturing the national economy. But it must say something that those who have benefited most from Chinaâ€™s property boom are now looking elsewhere for opportunity..

I speculate that in large cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, the demand truly exceeds the supply. Equally true is the bubble in 2nd and 3rd tier cities. The supply in small cities and towns is the result of developers unable to obtain land in large cities due to the distortion of market by policies. The rising temperature in property market in Beijing and the bubbles in the outback of Inner Mongolia are the two sides of the same coin.
