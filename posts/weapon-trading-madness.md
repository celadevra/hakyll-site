[Mapping Arms Data](http://balder.prio.no/armsglobe2/index.php) is a wonderful visualization and interactive map made using data on small arms and ammunition trade by Google Creative Lab and Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO).

The visual effect is very catchy, with zoomable 3-D globe, gracefully done highlighting and glowing effects.  My only complain is that the colours telling types of goods may use a more contrasting colour scheme.
