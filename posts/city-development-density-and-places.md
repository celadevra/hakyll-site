[*The city triumphs, again* -- Babbage blog, the Economist](http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2013/06/urbanisation)

In the above link, the author points to studies on the relationship between city size and innovation generated in the city, and reach the conclusion that bigger cities tend to become the incubator of talents, as the flowering of Florence during the Renaissance shows.  Further, the author cites a study by Wei Pan from MIT, which proposes a model that uses population density as the explaining factor.

Apparently some city planners are already using the idea to create high-density and high-connection zones.  How do they do that? By building special-purpose parks, zones, and links.  These facilities are believed to facilitate the communication of talented minds.

What is also important, is that not only similar minds are brought together.  And I argue that science parks do not help mingle different types of talents and generate new ideas by default.  The formation of cooperation among industries and companies and informal relationships between individuals are vital for innavation[^1].  City density helps with building such relationships, but only with adequate infrastructures can good communications and cooperations take place.

The diversity of a talent pool is also vital for sustained innovation.  Diversity attracts talent, by providing demands and multiple lifestyle options, which are called "place-based characteristics"[^2].  Diversity also means people of all kinds of race, gender, nationality and sex orientation can find a position in the society and contribute their knowledge.

Seeing from this light, the success story of Florence during the Renaissance and that of Silicon Valley today is not just stories of bigger, denser cities.  The success must be attributed to improved infrastructure, a more tolerant society, and means of communication and cooperation.  City triumphs because it provides these perks, but can also fail if the planners only seek to grow in scale but not in diversity and amenity of places.
